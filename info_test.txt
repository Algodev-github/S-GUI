Throughput benchmark: 
Measures the aggregated throughput with parallel, greedy (i.e., continuously issuing disk requests readers and/or writers. Both readers and writers are implemented with fio, and may be sequential or random. Files are read from and written to the /tmp/test directory (created if non existing). This type of workload is also used as background in the other tests. At the end of the test, the min, max, avg, std deviation, confidence interval of the read/write/total aggregated throughput values sampled during the run is reported.

Responsivness benchmark: 
Measures the cold-cache startup latency of the given command, launched while the same configurable workload used in the agg_thr test is running. At the end of the test reports min, max, avg, std dev and conf interval of both the sampled latencies and the read/write/total aggregated throughput.
